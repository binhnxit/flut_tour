* Write a `Future` function inside the request class (*), this function must return the http Response info.
* Inside the `Provider` class, write a `Future` function, the main responsibility of this function is call the `Future` function inside the request class (*) with specified `Duration`.
* Handle the Response (parse data, request status code...).
